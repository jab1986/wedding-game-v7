Glen: Wait... is this my shed? Why am I holding drumsticks?
Mark: Glen! We need your help. Jenny's been kidnapped by aliens!
Glen: Aliens? I thought this was a bingo game...
Mark: Focus Glen! Do you remember anything weird happening today?
Glen: Well, I did find some mushrooms behind the shed...
- Tell him about the aliens
	Mark: There were bright lights and weird sounds!
	Glen: Oh right! The space bingo tournament!
	-> remember_aliens

	Mark: What kind of mushrooms?
	Glen: The colorful dancing ones... they were very friendly.

Glen: Now I remember! They said something about a "wedding disruption protocol"
Mark: That sounds serious. Do you know where they took Jenny?
Glen: They mentioned the Amsterdam canals... something about a "final boss fight"
Mark: We have to get there! Can you help?
Glen: Of course! I'll bring my lucky bingo dabber!

Glen: They told me the secret of happiness is... *hiccup* ...finding your car keys.
Mark: Glen, that doesn't make sense.
Glen: Nothing makes sense anymore, Mark. That's the point!
Mark: We need to focus. Jenny needs our help!
Glen: Right! Jenny! She makes excellent sandwiches.
- Try to explain again
	Mark: The ALIENS took her, Glen!
	Glen: Ohhh, the space people! Why didn't you say so?
