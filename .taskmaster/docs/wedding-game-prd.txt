# Wedding Adventure Game - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
A charming SNES-style 2D adventure game following a couple's journey through various wedding-related scenarios. The game features exploration, mini-games, character interactions, and puzzle-solving elements across multiple themed levels.

## Technical Requirements
- **Engine**: Godot 4.3
- **Target Platform**: Desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Art Style**: 16-bit SNES-inspired pixel art
- **Audio**: Chiptune-style music and sound effects
- **Resolution**: 320x240 base resolution with pixel-perfect scaling

## Project Structure & Development Setup

### Repository & Version Control
- Initialize Git repository with proper .gitignore for Godot projects
- Set up branching strategy (main, develop, feature branches)
- Configure Cursor/VSCode settings for consistent formatting
- Establish commit message conventions
