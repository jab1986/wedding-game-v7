STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "AudioStreamPlayer audio bus effects management"

Enhance audio system:
1. Open Godot editor and navigate to the Audio dock.
2. Add an 'AudioStreamPlayer' node using the '+' button in the Scene dock.
3. Load audio files through the FileSystem dock and assign them in the Inspector.
4. Configure audio buses in the Audio dock for effects management.
5. Use the Inspector to set volume controls and audio settings.
6. Test audio transitions and effects using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not assigning audio files correctly in the Inspector.
- Forgetting to configure audio buses, leading to no sound output.

# Test Strategy:
Test music transitions, sound effect triggering, volume controls, audio settings persistence using Godot's play and debug tools.
