# Task ID: 14
# Title: Create Comprehensive Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement beginner-friendly testing strategies including unit tests, integration tests, and automated testing for game systems.
# Details:
STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "GDScript testing unit tests integration tests"

Create testing framework:
1. Open Godot editor and navigate to the script editor.
2. Write unit tests using GDScript for core systems.
3. Implement integration tests by creating test scenes and using the Inspector.
4. Set up automated input testing using the InputMap in Project Settings.
5. Save test scripts using the FileSystem dock.
6. Run tests using Godot's built-in test runner.

Common Mistakes:
- Not organizing test scripts properly, leading to confusion.
- Forgetting to run tests regularly, causing undetected issues.

# Test Strategy:
Verify test coverage, automated test execution, performance benchmarks, regression detection using Godot's built-in test runner.
