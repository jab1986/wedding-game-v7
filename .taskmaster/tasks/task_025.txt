STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for relevant documentation for launch preparation and post-launch support.

Launch preparation:
1. Open Godot editor and finalize build settings using the Export panel.
2. Coordinate release schedule using external project management tools.
3. Set up launch day monitoring using external monitoring tools.
4. Establish post-launch support processes using external communication tools.
5. Prepare update deployment pipeline using external version control tools.
6. Test release process using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not coordinating release schedule properly, leading to launch delays.
- Forgetting to prepare post-launch support, causing user dissatisfaction.

# Test Strategy:
Test release process, verify monitoring systems, test update deployment, prepare support documentation using external review tools.
