- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "Audio importing sound effects music"

Audio content:
1. Open Godot editor and navigate to the Audio dock.
2. Import chiptune music and sound effects using the FileSystem dock.
3. Assign audio files to 'AudioStreamPlayer' nodes in the Scene dock.
4. Configure audio settings in the Inspector for volume and looping.
5. Save changes using the FileSystem dock.
6. Test audio integration using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
