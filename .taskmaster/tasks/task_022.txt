STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for relevant documentation for bug fixing and quality assurance.

QA process:
1. Open Godot editor and use the 'Debugger' panel for bug identification.
2. Track issues using an external issue tracking tool.
3. Fix bugs by editing scripts in the script editor.
4. Conduct regression testing using the play button.
5. Perform edge case testing using the Inspector.
6. Complete final quality assurance review using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not tracking issues systematically, leading to missed bugs.
- Forgetting to conduct regression testing, causing reoccurring issues.

# Test Strategy:
Bug tracking system, regression test suite, edge case coverage, final QA checklist completion using Godot's play and debug tools.
