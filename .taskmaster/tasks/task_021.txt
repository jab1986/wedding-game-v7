STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for relevant documentation for playtesting and feedback integration.

Playtesting process:
1. Open Godot editor and use the play button for internal testing.
2. Conduct external playtesting with target audience using exported builds.
3. Collect feedback using surveys or interviews.
4. Analyze feedback and prioritize improvements using the script editor.
5. Implement changes based on feedback using the Inspector.
6. Test improvements using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not collecting enough feedback, leading to incomplete improvements.
- Forgetting to prioritize feedback, causing inefficient changes.

# Test Strategy:
Test with diverse user groups, collect quantitative and qualitative feedback, measure improvement effectiveness using Godot's play and debug tools.
