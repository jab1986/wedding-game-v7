STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "Resource management UI integration signals JSON serialization"

Create inventory system:
1. Open Godot editor and create a new scene using the 'Scene' menu.
2. Add a 'Control' node by clicking the '+' button in the Scene dock.
3. Use the Inspector panel to set anchors for the Control node.
4. Add child nodes for inventory items using the '+' button.
5. Connect signals through the Node dock for item interactions.
6. Save the scene using the FileSystem dock.
7. Test the inventory UI using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Forgetting to save the scene after changes.
- Not setting anchors properly, leading to UI misalignment.

# Test Strategy:
Test item pickup, inventory UI updates, save/load persistence, edge cases (full inventory, duplicate items) using Godot's built-in play and debug tools.
