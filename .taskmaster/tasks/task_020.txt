- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for relevant documentation for creating and managing documentation.

Documentation:

2. Develop a user manual using external documentation tools.
3. Create developer documentation by organizing scripts in the FileSystem dock.
4. Write API documentation for systems using GDScript comments.
5. Save documentation files using the FileSystem dock.

Common Mistakes:
- Not organizing documentation properly, leading to confusion.
- Forgetting to review documentation, causing inaccuracies.

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation accuracy, test installation instructions, verify troubleshooting steps using external documentation tools.
