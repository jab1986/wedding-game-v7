Create bingo mini-game:
1. Open Godot editor and create a new scene for the bingo mini-game using the 'Scene' menu.
2. Add 'Control' nodes for bingo card display and configure in the Inspector.
3. Implement pattern recognition using GDScript in the script editor.
4. Set up scoring and win conditions by connecting signals through the Node dock.
5. Save the scene using the FileSystem dock.
6. Test the mini-game using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not configuring nodes properly, leading to gameplay issues.
- Forgetting to test pattern recognition thoroughly, causing errors.

# Test Strategy:
Test bingo mechanics, pattern recognition accuracy, scoring system, win conditions, performance with multiple cards using Godot's play and debug tools.
