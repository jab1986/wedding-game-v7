STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "Control UI anchors themes signals menu HUD"

Create UI components:
1. Open Godot editor and create a new scene for each UI component using the 'Scene' menu.
2. Add 'Control' nodes for main menu, pause menu, HUD, and dialogue system using the '+' button.
3. Set anchors and margins in the Inspector for proper alignment.
4. Apply themes through the Inspector by selecting theme resources.
5. Connect UI signals through the Node dock for interactions.
6. Save each UI scene using the FileSystem dock.
7. Test UI functionality using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not setting anchors, causing UI elements to move unexpectedly.
- Forgetting to connect signals, leading to non-responsive UI.

# Test Strategy:
Test all UI interactions, menu navigation, settings persistence, dialogue system functionality using Godot's play and debug tools.
