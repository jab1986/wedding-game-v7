STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for relevant documentation for export and distribution setup.

Export setup:
1. Open Godot editor and navigate to 'Project' > 'Export' in the menu.
2. Configure export templates for Windows, macOS, Linux using the Export panel.
3. Optimize build settings for each platform using the Inspector.
4. Set up distribution channels (Steam, itch.io, etc.) using external tools.
5. Create installer packages using the Export panel.
6. Test exports on each target platform using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not configuring export templates correctly, leading to build failures.
- Forgetting to test exports on all platforms, causing compatibility issues.

# Test Strategy:
Test exports on each target platform, verify installer functionality, test distribution channel integration using Godot's play and debug tools.
