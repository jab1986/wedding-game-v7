Create Leo's Cafe:
1. Open Godot editor and create a new scene for Leo's Cafe using the 'Scene' menu.
2. Add nodes for social interactions and configure in the Inspector.
3. Develop character dialogue trees using 'Control' nodes and connect signals.
4. Integrate mini-games by adding 'Control' nodes and setting properties.
5. Save the scene using the FileSystem dock.
6. Test the scene using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not connecting dialogue signals, leading to non-functional interactions.
- Forgetting to save the scene, causing loss of progress.

# Test Strategy:
Test dialogue system, mini-game mechanics, character development tracking, scene atmosphere using Godot's play and debug tools.
