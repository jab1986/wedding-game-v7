STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "Scene management transitions resource loading"

Enhance Amsterdam level:
1. Open Godot editor and load Amsterdam level using the FileSystem dock.
2. Add exploration areas using 'StaticBody' nodes and configure in the Inspector.
3. Create environmental puzzles by adding 'Area' nodes and setting properties.
4. Integrate cultural elements by importing assets through the FileSystem dock.
5. Save changes using the FileSystem dock.
6. Test the level using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not configuring nodes properly, leading to gameplay issues.
- Forgetting to save changes, causing data loss.

# Test Strategy:
Test exploration mechanics, puzzle solutions, level navigation, cultural accuracy, performance optimization using Godot's play and debug tools.
