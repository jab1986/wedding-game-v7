# Task ID: 3
# Title: Create Core Game Architecture & Autoloads
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement singleton systems for game management, audio management, and scene transitions using Godot's autoload system.
# Details:
Create autoload scripts:
- GameManager (game state, progress tracking)
- AudioManager (music/SFX management)
- SceneTransition (smooth scene changes)
- SaveSystem (save/load functionality)
Configure autoloads in project settings

# Test Strategy:
Test each autoload system independently, verify singleton access from other scripts, test scene persistence
