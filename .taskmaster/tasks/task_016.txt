STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "UI accessibility keyboard navigation"

Accessibility features:
1. Open Godot editor and navigate to the InputMap in Project Settings.
2. Set up full keyboard navigation by configuring input actions.
3. Implement colorblind-friendly color schemes using the Inspector.
4. Add adjustable text size options by creating UI elements in the Scene dock.
5. Save changes using the FileSystem dock.
6. Test accessibility features using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not configuring input actions correctly, leading to navigation issues.
- Forgetting to test accessibility features thoroughly, causing usability problems.

# Test Strategy:
Test with accessibility tools, colorblind simulation, keyboard-only navigation, various text sizes using Godot's play and debug tools.
