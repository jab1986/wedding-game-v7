# Task ID: 17
# Title: Create Art Asset Pipeline
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish a beginner-friendly consistent art creation workflow, sprite standards, and asset optimization for the SNES-style aesthetic.
# Details:
STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "Resource importing texture optimization"

Art pipeline:
1. Open Godot editor and use the FileSystem dock to organize art assets.
2. Set sprite creation standards by creating templates in the Scene dock.
3. Ensure color palette consistency by setting colors in the Inspector.
4. Optimize animation frames using the AnimationPlayer node.
5. Save assets using the FileSystem dock.
6. Test asset performance using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not organizing assets properly, leading to confusion.
- Forgetting to test asset performance, causing slowdowns.

# Test Strategy:
Verify art consistency, sprite alignment, animation smoothness, file size optimization, loading performance using Godot's play and debug tools.
