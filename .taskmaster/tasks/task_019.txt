For this task, search for relevant documentation for analytics and telemetry implementation.

Analytics system:
1. Open Godot editor and create a new script for analytics using the script editor.
2. Implement player progression tracking using GDScript.
3. Set up data collection by connecting signals through the Node dock.
4. Ensure privacy compliance by configuring settings in Project Settings.
5. Save scripts using the FileSystem dock.
6. Test analytics using the play button and debug tools.

Common Mistakes:
- Not ensuring privacy compliance, leading to potential issues.
- Forgetting to test data collection, causing inaccurate analytics.

# Test Strategy:
Test data collection accuracy, privacy compliance, performance impact, dashboard functionality using Godot's play and debug tools.
