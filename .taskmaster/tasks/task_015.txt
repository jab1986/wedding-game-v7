# Task ID: 15
# Title: Optimize Performance & Memory Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Profile and optimize game performance with beginner-friendly memory management, ensuring smooth gameplay across target platforms.

STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "Performance optimization memory management profiling"

Performance optimization:
1. Open Godot editor and use the 'Debugger' panel for profiling.
2. Monitor CPU and memory usage using the 'Profiler' tab.
3. Optimize sprite rendering by adjusting properties in the Inspector.
4. Implement object pooling using GDScript in the script editor.
5. Save changes using the FileSystem dock.
6. Test performance using the play button and Profiler.

Common Mistakes:
- Not monitoring performance regularly, leading to unnoticed issues.
- Forgetting to save optimization changes, causing data loss.

# Test Strategy:
Performance profiling, memory usage monitoring, frame rate consistency testing, resource loading optimization using Godot's play and debug tools.
