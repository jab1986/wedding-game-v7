# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Save/Load System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a beginner-friendly save/load system that preserves game progress, settings, and inventory state across sessions.
# Details:
STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "FileAccess JSON serialization user data persistence"

Implement save system:
1. Open Godot editor and create a new script for save/load functionality.
2. Use the FileSystem dock to organize save files.
3. Implement save/load logic using GDScript in the script editor.
4. Attach the script to a node using the Inspector.
5. Test save/load functionality using the play button and debug tools.

Common Mistakes:
- Not organizing save files properly, leading to data loss.
- Forgetting to test save/load logic thoroughly, causing errors.

# Test Strategy:
Test save/load functionality, data integrity, multiple save slots, corruption handling, cross-session persistence using Godot's play and debug tools.
