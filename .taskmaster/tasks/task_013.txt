# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Scene Transition System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create beginner-friendly smooth scene transitions with loading screens, fade effects, and proper state management between levels.
# Details:
STEP 0: Context7 Documentation Check (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
Before starting implementation, MUST search Context7 for relevant Godot documentation:
- Use `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` with `/godotengine/godot-docs`
- Search for specific topics related to the task
- Document key findings and patterns
- Follow Context7 documented best practices

For this task, search for: "Scene loading transitions autoload patterns"

Create transition system:
1. Open Godot editor and create a new scene for transitions using the 'Scene' menu.
2. Add 'Control' nodes for fade effects and configure in the Inspector.
3. Implement loading screens by adding 'TextureRect' nodes and setting properties.
4. Use the Project Settings to configure autoload for state management.
5. Save the scene using the FileSystem dock.
6. Test transitions using the play button.

Common Mistakes:
- Not setting up autoload correctly, leading to state loss.
- Forgetting to test transitions thoroughly, causing visual inconsistencies.

# Test Strategy:
Test transition smoothness, loading times, state preservation, memory management, visual consistency using Godot's play and debug tools.
